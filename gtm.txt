*********** Google Tag Manager ************

Tags is usually a tracking code that you want to implement on your website.
It might be Facebook pixel event tag, might be Google Analytics, page view,
google ads conversion code or whatever.

So if you want activate a certain tracking code on site that is a tag, then
there are triggers. Triggers are conditions when you want your tags to fire.

Then there is a third component, which is called variables. Variables are
little data points that you can use in tags or triggers. Sometimes variables
might contain more information. Sometimes variables are even more complex
functions. 

But in this case, you should start simple. So you can just think of variables
as data points that can contain a single value, or maybe a bit more complex,
but still some information, some data or some configuration. 

**** Tags, Triggers & Variables: 3 questions ***

* What do you want GTM to do? - Tag 
* When do you want to do it? - Trigger
* What/when/how exactly? - Variable

-> Tag is a piece of JavaScript that you want to activate on your site.
-> Trigger is a condition when you want to happen.
-> Varible is data point or adding up some set of information or may be some
function that you use to either to make the trigger more specific or to
transfer that particular data to third party tools. And I believe that 
variables are the most confusing.  


Example:

       Tag                      Trigger
|----------------|          |------------------------|
|   Google Ads   |          | On a Thank you Page    |
| Conversion Tag |----------|                        |
|                |          |      variable:         |
|                |          |       Page URL:        |
|                |          |  /purchase-successful/ | 
|----------------|          |------------------------|



we want our trigger to fire not on any page view, but only on those pages,
where a variable, which is Page URL contains "/purchase-successful/", because
we know know that a visitor lands on this page only when that visitor has 
actually purchased something. So this is our conversion.
